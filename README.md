# Cli2Gui

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

**Project Description:**

`Cli2Gui` enables you to convert command-line interface (CLI) applications into graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) with minimal effort. Designed to accommodate a wide variety of use cases,
this library allows developers to maintain a CLI while seamlessly enabling a GUI option for
popular Python parsers like `argparse`, `docopt` with GUI frameworks such as `freesimplegui`,
`dearpygui`, and more. By using `Cli2Gui`, developers can extend the accessibility of their
applications, catering to both command-line users and those who prefer interactive graphical tools.

With a decorator-based approach, `Cli2Gui` allows you to keep your CLI logic intact while adding
GUI support as needed. Customization options such as theming, custom icons, and program descriptions
make it easy to enhance the user experience. Whether you are working on small scripts or complex
tools, `Cli2Gui` provides a flexible and user-friendly way to bridge the gap between command-line
and graphical interfaces, offering convenience for both developers and end-users.

## Documentation

A high-level overview of how the documentation is organized organized will help you know
where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get
  started using the software. Start here if youâ€™re new.
- The [Technical Reference](/documentation/reference) documents APIs and other aspects of the
  machinery. This documentation describes how to use the classes and functions at a lower level
  and assume that you have a good high-level understanding of the software.
<!--
- The [Help](/documentation/help) guide provides a starting point and outlines common issues that you
  may have.
-->

## Install With PIP

```python
pip install cli2gui
```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/cli2gui/ for more info

## Language information

### Built for

This program has been written for Python versions 3.8 - 3.11 and has been tested with both 3.8 and
3.11

## Building

This project uses https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/FHMake to automate most of the building. This
command generates the documentation, updates the requirements.txt and builds the library artefacts

Note the functionality provided by fhmake can be approximated by the following

```sh
handsdown  --cleanup -o documentation/reference
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with dev --output requirements_optional.txt
poetry build
```

`fhmake audit` can be run to perform additional checks
